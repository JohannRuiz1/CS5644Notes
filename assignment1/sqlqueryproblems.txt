Practice writing SQL queries
-----------------------------

For this question, we will consider the following tables about
people, grades, and courses. Your task is to express each
of the given queries in SQL. Example data are provided in these
tables for your convenience but note that they are only example data. 
Your queries must work for all potential data residing in the given 
tables, not just those illustrated here.

People (id, name, age, address)
---------------------------------------------------
p1  | Tom Martin| 24 | 11, Integer Avenue, Fractions, MA
p2  | Al Smith  | 33 | 26, Main Street, Noman's Land, PA
p3  | Kim Burton| 40 | 45, Elm Street, Blacksburg, VA
---------------------------------------------------

Courses (id, name, department)
---------------------------------------------------------
c1 | Systematic Torture | MATH
c2 | Pretty Painful     | CS
c3 | Not so Bad         | MATH
c4 | Big Data 		      | CS
---------------------------------------------------------

Grades (pid, cid, grade)
---------------------------------------------------
p1  |  c1    	| 3.5 
p2  |  c3		| 2.5
p3  |  c2      | 4.0
p3  |  c4      | 3.85
---------------------------------------------------

1. Find the names of courses taken by Tom Martin.

# Implicit Join
SELECT C.name FROM People AS P, Courses AS C, Grades AS G WHERE P.id = G.pid AND C.id = G.cid AND P.name = 'Tom Martin';

# Explicit Join
SELECT C.name FROM People AS P JOIN Grades AS G ON P.id = G.pid JOIN Courses AS C ON G.cid = C.id WHERE p.name = 'Tom Martin';

2. Print person name, course name, and grade in a convenient format.

SELECT P.name, C.name, G.grade FROM People AS P, Courses AS C, Grades AS G WHERE P.id = G.pid AND C.id = G.cid;

3. Print person names and their grades in MATH courses.

SELECT P.name, G.grade FROM People AS P, Courses AS C, Grades AS G WHERE P.id = G.pid AND C.id = G.cid AND C.department = 'MATH';

4. Find the names of courses that people from VA have taken.

SELECT C.name FROM People AS P, Courses AS C, Grades AS G WHERE P.id = G.pid AND C.id = G.cid AND P.address LIKE '%VA%';

5. Find the names of people who received a grade of 3 or better in some
   course. List the namesmes of these people alongside the course names.

SELECT P.name, C.name FROM People AS P, Courses AS C, Grades AS G WHERE P.id = G.pid AND C.id = G.cid AND G.grade >= 3;

6. Find the names of people who received a grade of 3.5 or better in at
   least two courses.

SELECT DISTINCT P.name FROM People AS P, Grades AS G1, Grades AS G2 WHERE G1.pid = G2.pid AND G1.cid != G2.cid AND G1.grade >= 3.5 AND G2.grade >= 3.5 AND P.id = G1.pid;

7. Find the names of people who received a grade of 3.5 or better in at least
   three courses.

SELECT DISTINCT P.name FROM People AS P, Grades AS G1, Grades AS G2, Grades AS G3  WHERE G1.pid = G2.pid AND G2.pid = G3.pid AND G1.pid = G3.pid  AND G1.cid != G2.cid AND G2.cid != G3.cid AND G1.cid != G3.cid AND G1.grade >= 3.5 AND G2.grade >= 3.5 AND G3.grade >= 3.5 AND P.id = G1.pid;

8. Find the names of people who received a grade of 3.5 or better in exactly
   two courses.


9. What is the name of the person who received the highest grade in the "Big Data" course?

SELECT P.name FROM People AS P, Courses AS C, Grades AS G WHERE P.id = G.pid AND C.id = G.cid AND C.name = 'Big Data' ORDER BY G.grade DESC LIMIT 1;

10. This question builds on the previous question; what is the name of the person
   who received the second highest grade in the "Big Data" course? 

SELECT P.name FROM People AS P, Courses AS C, Grades AS G WHERE P.id = G.pid AND C.id = G.cid AND C.name = 'Big Data' ORDER BY G.grade DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;

11. Find the names of people who received a grade of 3.5 or better in every course (given in
   the Courses table).


12. Find the names of people who received a grade of 3.5 or better in every course they have taken.
