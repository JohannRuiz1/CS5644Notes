### What is Machine Learning?
Formal Definition: The ability of a computer program to improve its performance over time (without explicit programming, done automatically)
For our purposes: The ability of a computer program to learn from data and make predictions about the future

### Types of Machine Learning
- Supervised Learning
	- Provided with <input, output> pairs and asks to predict output given a new input
	- Instructive feedback (easier to learn)
- Unsupervised Learning
	- Provides inputs and asked to identify patterns within it
	- No feedback
- Reinforcement Learning
	- Provides inputs, asks to predict outputs, and tells algorithm whether the choice was good or bad
	- Ex. Learning to drive a car: One cannot map out every possible input to driving and create a table on whether it was a good decision or not. Therefore, must provide the algorithm with a yes or no to the decision in the moment based on the criteria and the outcome
	- Evaluative feedback (easier to obtain)
