- Forms of "model" in a linear classifier
	- Geometry of the line (2D) or plane (in higher dimensions)
	- The coefficients of the linear expression
	- Which side of the line is the class
- How to learn a classifier
	- Estimating the weights <b>w</b>
	- Solution
		- Mistake-driven approach
		- Guess all weights
		- Repeat
		- Only works if examples are linearly separable in the first place
	- Not linearly separable
		- Come up with complex constructs
		- one hyperplane = one nueron
		- lots of hyperplanes = neural netwrok
		- zillions of hyperplanes = deep neural network
